            <h2 >About Me</h2>
            <p> Hello, my name is Harrison. I'm an aspiring Software Engineer 
                and am currently enrolled in Boston Univeristy's Master of 
                Science in Software Development Program. Professionally, I work 
                in Software Quality Assurance and Testing, but have spent much 
                of my career working in the Financial Services industry. 
                Outside of work and my studies, I enjoy lifting weights and 
                playing sports. I hope you enjoy my portfolio!</p>
            <p>
                If you would like to learn more about my hobbies and interests
                outside of work, please click

        <section class="index-goals">
            <h2>Goals, Aspirations, and More About Me</h2>
            <p>My hope is that I can use some of the skills and knowledge 
                obtained through my coursework and self learning to help a 
                company improve the quality and scale of their software. 
                Beyond software, I have a deep passion and knowlege of the 
                capital markets and financial services industry. Throughout 
                my career I have held the Series 7, 63, 65, and 66 
                licenses. I love to learn and am excited for the 
                opportunity to show you some of the many skills I have 
                developed and continue to improve.</p>
