portfolio.html – This page is used to display some of the projects I have created. The page uses main.css as the style sheet. It also uses the JavaScript file portfolio.js to manipulate the DOM and create an interactive viewing experience for the user. Each project has a zip file that can be downloaded, as well as a link to each project’s GitHub repository. The NBA Data Science and DOW 30 Portfolio Builder projects have embedded video overviews as well. To access each project, the user can simply click on the project’s icon, this reveals and scrolls to the specific project, all while staying on the same page, without having to open separate tabs. To go back to the top of the page, to view the other projects, the user can either scroll, or click the “Top Of The Page” link, which will bring them back to the top of the page. As the user continues to click each project icon, the projects will display on the page and automatically scroll into view.

Once the user hovers over the image, the image changes, and the corresponding text for that image changes as well, giving a brief overview of the class(es) I have used the language in and the corresponding projects that the language(s) was used to create.
