            <h1>Education</h1>
            <p class="education-desc">I graduated from the University of New 
                Hampshire with a 
                Bachelor of Science in 2014 and spent most of my career in
                the financial services industry. Looking for a change, I
                discovered software development/engineering. I began to teach
                myself front-end development and quickly fell in love with
                coding. With the hopes of pursuing a career in software 
                development/engineering, I enrolled in Boston University's
                Master of Science in Software Development program, where I am a
                current student. Below is some more information regarding my
                studies thus far at Boston University.</p>
