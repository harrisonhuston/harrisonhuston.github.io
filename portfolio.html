                two creational, two structural, and two behavioral design 
                patterns. The program itself simulates the management of a
                department within an educational setting. Within the project,
                documentation is provided to describe each pattern, why it was
                used, the important code in its implementation, and provide for

            <p class="port-desc">Below are a handful of the many 
                projects/programs I have created while pursuing my degree at 
                Boston University. They incorporate a variety of skills and 
                languages, with each having a brief description, detailing the 
                nature of the program. The source code is also made easily 
                available for you to download. Thank you and I hope you enjoy 
                my work.

                various design patterns within Java. This includes the use of
                two creational, two structural, and two behavioral design 
                patterns. The program itself simulates the management of a
                department within an educational setting. Within the project,
                documentation is provided to describe each pattern, why it is
                used, the important code in its implementation, and allow for

                BestPurchase Application.<br><br>
            
                <b>Part 1</b> 
                <br>
                Focuses on defining the scope and mission statement, as well as 
                the creation of user stories and use cases. Functional and 
                non-functional requirements are determined, and the State 
                Transition, Sub-States, and Graphical User Interface designs 
                are created.

                Focuses on designing with the Unified Modeling Language (UML). 
                A use case is selected and revised. A Sequence and Class Model 
                diagram are created. Three business classes are selected, 
                as well as one non-business class. These classes are described 
                in relation to the design and their relationship to other 
                classes.

                Focuses on the design goals and data flows. The Class Model 
                diagram is revised to include packages. The packages are 
                described with their name, design goals, and design tradeoffs. 
                The Logical Data Flow and Physical Data Flow diagrams are

                Focuses on specifying design details. An updated Class Model 
                diagram is presented. A method from the Class Model diagram is 
                selected and an Activity diagram pertaining to this method is 
                displayed. A Focused Sequence diagram is created based on an 
                activity from the Activity diagram. Lastly, pseudocode is
